            <h2>Begin With Your Grocery List</h2>
            <p>Each individual and family has their own favorite things to eat, methods of cooking, and brands of products they use.
            The best place to start is with your grocery list. When we began planning our home storage, we started keeping our
            weekly grocery list, which included a list of possible meals. These lists provided a snapshot of what we ate on a
            regular basis, and how often we purchased non-food items. By looking at the meals, we could pull out recipes that worked
            well for home storage. Those meals had shelf-stable ingredients as well as ingredients that could be frozen or canned.
            We also eliminated meals that were mainly fresh ingredients, like green salads, that couldn’t be stored.</p>
            <p>Using our list of storable recipes, we then decided how many times in a three-month period we would be willing to eat
            them. The goal was to have as many recipes as possible, to give us a good amount of variety. It is also important to
            consider nutritional value and include recipes that will add up to a healthy diet. Once we had enough meals, we
            calculated totals of all the combined ingredients, based on recipe frequency. These ingredients, added to basic usage
            amounts (things like olive oil are used separately from recipes, so those amounts need to be added) became our list of
            what to store. If the math seems overwhelming, check out our 
            <a href="index.html#app"> Home Corner Market App </a> which will do the calculations for
            you.</p>
            <p>Don’t forget to consider foods that you eat for breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, and dessert. When you are eating only
            the food you have stored, snacks are especially important for feeling like life is normal.</p>
            <p>Last of all, begin picking up an extra few items each week to add to your storage. Remember to use them and simply
            replace them as you go along, adding more along the way. Pretty soon you will have your own in-home market where you can grab the 
            things you need, as you need them.</p>
